# CineSphere Sign-in & Sign-up Form

Welcome to CineSphere's sign-in and sign-up form project!

## Description
The code comprises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a modern sign-in and sign-up form for "CineSphere." It includes separate forms for signing in and signing up, with social media login options. JavaScript toggles between these forms based on user clicks, providing a smooth interface transition.

## Features
- I created separate forms for signing in and signing up.
- I structured the page with semantic HTML, dividing it into sections like forms and panels.
- Styled the page with custom fonts, colors, and layouts.
- Ensured responsiveness across different screen sizes using Flexbox or Grid layout.
- Implemented dynamic behavior to toggle between sign-in and sign-up modes without page reloads.
- Listened for click events on sign-in and sign-up buttons to trigger mode changes.
